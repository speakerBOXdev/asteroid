Description:
  A simple proof-of-concept game based on object-oriented JavaScript and HTML5 canvas development. This was originally taken from an online tutorial and then greatly expanded for flexibility and managebility. Aside from refactored code, added features include a constantly rendered background providing "dynamic" gameplay with moving obstacles, variable speed character, option for the user to pause the game, and more sophistication in collision detection. I added code specifically for debugging and error handling. The game uses CSS transformations to "shake" the canvas when the player collides with an asteroid and removes the css class so it can be applied again on a second collision. This game is not "ready for production" as there is still room for improvement but was a great learning effort and a large improvement over the original.



Instructions:
	Space ship (blue circle) is controlled by arrow keys.
	Esc key will pause the game.
	Clicking Start or the spacebar will begin the game.
	Clicking Resume or the spacebar will resume the game.
	Clicking Restart will begin a new game.
